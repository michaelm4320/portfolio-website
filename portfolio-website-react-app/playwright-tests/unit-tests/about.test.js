My journey in technology began when I picked up my first Nintendo controller, sparking a lifelong enthusiasm for all things tech. Since then, Iâ€™ve committed myself to continuous learning, always striving to design smarter, more robust software applications. With each project, I'm constantly pushing the boundaries of my development skills, one line of code at a time. My goal is to bring joy and put smiles on people's faces through the software I build in order to help make a positive impact for our community. And when I'm not coding, I'm playing my favorite video games and exploring ways how I can enhance the games I grew up with by creating mods for games like Minecraft.");
