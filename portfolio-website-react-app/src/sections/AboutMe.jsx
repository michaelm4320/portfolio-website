              I'm Michael, a Software Engineer driven by a passion for creating
              innovative software solutions that shape a brighter tomorrow. My
              journey in technology began when I picked up my first Nintendo
              controller, sparking a lifelong enthusiasm for all things tech.
              Since then, Iâ€™ve committed myself to continuous learning, always
              striving to design smarter, more robust software applications.
              <br /> <br />
              With each project, I'm constantly pushing the boundaries of my
              development skills, one line of code at a time. My goal is to
              bring joy and put smiles on people's faces through the software I
              build in order to help make a positive impact for our community.
              And when I'm not coding, I'm playing my favorite video games and
              exploring ways how I can enhance the games I grew up with by
              creating mods for games like Minecraft.
