## Testing Strategy

### Front-End Testing

- **Unit Testing**:
  - **Library**: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
  - **Usage**: Used for writing unit tests for individual components and functions.
  - **Example**: Testing if a React component renders correctly or if a function returns expected results.

- **Integration Testing**:
  - **Library**: [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
  - **Usage**: Used for testing how various components interact with each other.
  - **Example**: Testing if a user can interact with a form component and see expected results.

- **End-to-End Testing**:
  - **Library**: [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
  - **Usage**: Used for testing the application as a whole, simulating user interactions and verifying the applicationâ€™s behavior.
  - **Example**: Testing if a user can navigate through the site, fill out forms, and see expected results.

### Back-End Testing

- **Unit Testing**:
  - **Library**: [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/)
  - **Usage**: Used for writing unit tests for individual service methods and components in the Spring Boot application.
  - **Example**: Testing if a service method processes data correctly.

- **Integration Testing**:
  - **Library**: [Spring Boot Test](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing)
  - **Usage**: Used for testing interactions between various components of the Spring Boot application, such as repository interactions.
  - **Example**: Testing if a REST controller correctly interacts with the service layer and returns expected results.

- **Mocking**:
  - **Library**: [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/)
  - **Usage**: Used for creating mock objects and stubbing methods to test isolated components.
  - **Example**: Mocking a repository to test a service method independently from the database.
