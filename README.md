## CI/CD Pipeline

This CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building and deploying your project. Here's a simple breakdown of what each
part does:

### Backend Build

1. **Checkout Code**
    - Fetches the latest code from your GitHub repository.

2. **Set up JDK 17**
    - Installs Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17.

3. **Set up Maven**
    - Installs Maven, a build tool for Java projects.

4. **Build Backend**
    - Compiles and packages your backend code into a JAR file, skipping tests for faster builds.

5. **Inspect JAR Contents**
    - Lists the contents of the generated JAR file to ensure it's correct.

6. **Create SSH Private Key File**
    - Creates a file from the SSH private key stored in GitHub secrets for secure access to the deployment server.

7. **Add AWS Lightsail Host Key**
    - Adds the deployment serverâ€™s SSH key to known hosts to prevent SSH warnings during deployment.

8. **Deploy Backend to AWS Lightsail**
    - Removes the old JAR file from the server, copies the new JAR file to the server, and restarts the backend service
      with the new JAR.

### Frontend Build

1. **Checkout Code**
    - Fetches the latest code from your GitHub repository.

2. **Set up Node.js**
    - Installs Node.js version 16, needed for building the frontend.

3. **Install Dependencies**
    - Installs JavaScript libraries required for your frontend.

4. **Build Frontend**
    - Compiles and builds the frontend code into static files.

5. **Start Frontend Server**
    - Starts the frontend development server to serve your static files.

6. **Wait for Frontend Server to be Ready**
    - Waits until the frontend server is up and running.

7. **Install Playwright Browsers**
    - Installs the necessary browsers for Playwright testing.

8. **Run Playwright Tests**
    - Executes automated tests using Playwright to ensure the frontend works correctly.

## `package.json` Overview

The `package.json` file is a crucial part of any Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project,
including its dependencies, scripts, and configuration. In this project, `package.json` has been configured to
handle various tasks related to development and testing.

## Spring Boot

To run Spring Boot, run `mvn.cmd spring-boot:run` on the terminal in root.

## Scripts

The `scripts` section in `package.json` allows you to define commands that can be run from the terminal.
Here's an overview of the scripts set up for this project:

- **`dev`**: Runs the Vite development server. Use `npm run dev` to start the development server and view the
  application locally.
- **`test`**: Runs Playwright unit tests. Use `npm run test`.

## Playwright

**Playwright** is used for end-to-end (e2e) testing.

**Running Tests**

- **`npm run test`**
